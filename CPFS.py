'''Train a simple deep CNN on the CIFAR10 small images dataset.
GPU run command with Theano backend (with TensorFlow, the GPU is automatically used):
    THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatx=float32 python cifar10_cnn.py
It gets down to 0.65 test logloss in 25 epochs, and down to 0.55 after 50 epochs.
(it's still underfitting at that point, though).
